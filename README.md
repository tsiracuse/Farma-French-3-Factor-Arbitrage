# Farma-French-3-Factor-Arbitrage
This project provides a Python script that automates the creation of a tracking portfolio based on the Fama-French three-factor model (Market Risk, Size, and Value) to uncover potential arbitrage opportunities. It dynamically fetches historical stock data, computes factor betas, and determines the optimal weights for a tracking portfolio.
